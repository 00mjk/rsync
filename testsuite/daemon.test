# We don't really want to start the server listening, because that
# might interfere with the security or operation of the test machine.
# Instead we use the fake-connect feature to dynamically assign a pair
# of ports.

# Having started the server we try some basic operations against it:

# getting a list of module
# listing files in a module
# retrieving a module
# uploading to a module
# checking the log file
# password authentication

# TODO: Put the common framework in a common file, so that we can have
# subtests fail and keep going.

# This test starts up an rsync daemon on a high-numbered port using a
# configuration file from the test directory.  I can't think of a good
# way to choose it dynamically at the moment, so we just use 2612.  If
# that's in use then you lose.

# Having started the server we try some basic operations against it:

# getting a list of module
# listing files in a module
# retrieving a module
# uploading to a module
# checking the log file
# password authentication

# TODO: Put the common framework in a common file, so that we can have
# subtests fail and keep going.

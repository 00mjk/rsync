IMPORTANT ------------------------------------------------------------

Cross-test versions

  Part of the regression suite should be making sure that we don't
  break backwards compatibility: old clients vs new servers and so
  on.  Ideally we would test the cross product of versions.  

  It might be sufficient to test downloads from well-known public
  rsync servers running different versions of rsync.  This will give
  some testing and also be the most common case for having different
  versions and not being able to upgrade.


NICE -----------------------------------------------------------------

Merge IPv6 support ***

A patch is available at

        ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/rsync-244-v6-20000802.diff.gz

but tridge reckons it needs to be cleaned up before it can be
accepted.

This is now on the track-kameipv6 branch and can be moved across any
time.  The KAME people say that it should work on machines without
IPv6 stacks.

rsyncsh 

   Write a small emulation of interactive ftp as a Pythonn program
   that calls rsync.  Commands such as "cd", "ls", "ls *.c" etc map
   fairly directly into rsync commands: it just needs to remember the
   current host, directory and so on.  We can probably even do
   completion of remote filenames.

Merge IPv6 support ***

A patch is available at

        ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/rsync-244-v6-20000802.diff.gz

but tridge reckons it needs to be cleaned up before it can be
accepted.

This is now on the track-kameipv6 branch and can be moved across any
time.  The KAME people say that it should work on machines without
IPv6 stacks.

rsyncsh 

   Write a small emulation of interactive ftp as a Pythonn program
   that calls rsync.  Commands such as "cd", "ls", "ls *.c" etc map
   fairly directly into rsync commands: it just needs to remember the
   current host, directory and so on.  We can probably even do
   completion of remote filenames.

NEWS for rsync 2.6.9 (unreleased)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.8:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed the sanitizing of acceptable ../ dirs in 2 cases where an rsync
      daemon is receiving files when "use chroot" is not enabled and the
      destination dir is not at the top of the module's path:  both the value
      of a symlink and the arg of the --FOO-dest options (i.e.  --link-dest,
      --copy-dest, and --compare-dest) now know how deep the destination dir
      is in the module, and allow a safe number of ../ references instead of
      preventing the references from leaving the destination hierarchy (use
      the age-old --safe-links for that behavior).

    - Make sure that the --link-dest option can still do its job even when -I
      or --size-only is specified.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - ...

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The acls.diff and xattrs.diff patches have received a bunch of work to
      make them much closer to being acceptable in the main distribution.

    - Updated config.guess and config.sub to their 2006-02-23 version.

    - Updated various files to include the latest FSF address and to have
      consistent opening comments.

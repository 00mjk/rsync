NEWS for rsync 2.6.4 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 28 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Restore the list-clearing behavior of "!" in a .cvsignore file (2.6.3
      was only treating it as a special token in an rsync include/exclude
      file).

    - Avoid a mkdir warning when removing a directory in the destination
      that already exists in the --backup-dir.

    - An OS that has a binary mode for its files (such as cygwin0 needed
      setmode(fd, O_BINARY) called on the temp-file we opened with
      mkstemp().  (Fix picked up from the cygwin package.)

    - Fixed a potential hang when verbosity is high, the client side is
      the sender, and the file-list is large.

    - We now check if the OS doesn't support using mknod() for creating
      FIFOs and sockets, and compile-in using mkfifo() and socket() when
      necessary.

    - Fixed an off-by-one error in the handling of --max-delete=N.

    - One fork() call needed to check for and handle a failure.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Rsync now supports popt's option aliases, which means that you can
      use /etc/popt and/or ~/.popt to create your own option aliases.

    - Added the --max-size option (promoted from the patches dir).

    - The daemon-mode options were separated from the normal rsync options
      so that they can't be mixed together.  This makes it impossible for a
      user to start a daemon that had improper default option values that
      could cause problems (a hang or an exit) when a client connects.

    - The --bwlimit option may now be used in combination with --daemon
      to specify a default value for the daemon side and also a value
      that cannot be exceeded by a user-specified --bwlimit option.

    - In _exit_cleanup(): when we are exiting with a partially-received
      file, we now flush any data in the write-cache before closing the
      partial file.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Handle an operating system that use mkdev() in place of makedev().

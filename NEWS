NEWS for rsync 3.0.4 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the hard-linking code where it would sometimes try to
      allocate 0 bytes of memory (which fails on OSes, such as AIX).

    - Fixed a couple issues in the --fake-super handling of xattrs when the
      destination files have root-level attributes (e.g. selinux values) that
      a non-root copy can't affect.

    - Fixed a potential alignment issue in the IRIX ACL code when allocating
      the initial "struct acl" object.  Also, cast mallocs to avoid warnings.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Rsync will avoid sending an -e option to the server if an older protocol
      in requested (and thus the option would not be useful).  This lets the
      user specify the --protocol=29 option to access an overly-restrictive
      server.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The Makefile will not halt for just a timestamp change on the Makefile
      or the configure files, only for actual changes in content.

    - Enhanced the release scripts to be able to handle a branch release.

NEWS for rsync 3.0.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed two buffer-overflow issues: one where a directory path that is
      exactly MAXPATHLEN was not handled correctly, and one handling a
      --backup-dir that is extra extra large.

    - Fixed a potential crash when an rsync daemon has a filter/exclude list
      and the transfer is using ACLs or extended attributes.

    - Properly handle requesting remote filenames that start with a dash.

    - Fixed a bug in the comparing of upper-case letters in file suffixes for
      --skip-compress.

    - If an rsync daemon has a module configured without a path setting, rsync
      will now disallow access to that module.

    - If the destination arg is an empty string, it will be treated as a
      reference to the current directory (as 2.x used to do).

    - Fixed a batch-file writing bug that would not write out the full set of
      compatibility flags that the transfer was using.  This fixes a potential
      protocol problem for a batch file that contains a sender-side I/O error:
      it would have been sent in a way that the batch-reader wasn't expecting.

    - Some improvements to the hard-linking code to ensure that device-number
      hashing is working right, and to supply more information if the hard-link
      code fails.

    - The --inplace code was improved to not search for an impossible checksum
      position.  The quadruple-verbose chunk[N] message will now mention when
      an inplace chunk was handled by a seek rather than a read+write.

    - If we fail to connect to an rsync daemon, report all the connection
      errors (e.g. ipv4 & ipv6), not just the last one.

    - Fixed an issue where an xattr and/or acl transfer that used an alt-dest
      option (e.g. --link-dest) could output an error trying to itemize the
      changes against the alt-dest directory's xattr/acl info but was instead
      tryring to access the not-yet-existing new destination directory.

    - Improved xattr system-error messages to mention the full path to the
      file.

    - Improved the unsafe-symlink errors messages.

    - Fixed a bug setting xattrs on new files that aren't user writable.

    - Fixed a bug with --fake-super when copying files and dirs that aren't
      user writable.

    - Fix the popt arg parsing so that an option that doesn't take an arg will
      reject an attempt to supply and arg.

    - A couple minor option tweaks to support/rrsync script, and also some
      regex changes that make vim highlighting happier.

    - A few manpage improvements.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Use lchmod() whenever it is available (not just on symlinks).

    - A couple fixes to the socketpair_tcp() routine.

    - Updated the helper scripts in the packaging subdirectory.

    - Renamed configure.in to configure.ac.

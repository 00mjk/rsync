rsync 2.5.2 (???)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for setting local address of outgoing sockets.

    * Better handling of hardlinks and devices on platforms with
      64-bit dev_t or ino_t.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * --statistics now shows memory heap usage on platforms that
        support mallinfo().

    * "The Ted T'so school of program optimization": make progress
      visible and people will think it's faster.  (With --progress,
      rsync will show you how many files it has seen as it builds the
      file_list, giving some indication that it has not hung.)

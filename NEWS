NEWS for rsync 3.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the hard-linking code where it would sometimes try to
      allocate 0 bytes of memory (which fails on system OSes).

    - Changed the way --progress overwrites its prior output in order to make
      it nearly impossible for the progress to get overwritten by an error.

    - Improved the keep-alive in-loop check in the generator to work properly
      in incremental recursion mode.

    - Fixed a couple issues in the --fake-super handling of xattrs when the
      destination files have root-level attributes (e.g. selinux values) that
      a non-root copy can't affect.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --remote-option=OPT (-M OPT) command-line option that is useful
      for things like sending a remote --log-file=FILE or --fake-super option.

    - Added the --info=FLAGS and --debug=FLAGS options to allow finer-grained
      control over what is output.  Added an extra type of --progress output
      using --info=progress2.

    - Added the "%C" escape to the log-output handling, which will output the
      MD5 checksum of any transferred file, or all files if --checksum was
      specified (when protocol 30 or above is in effect).

    - Rsync will not send an -e option to the server if the user specifies the
      --protocol=29 option.  This lets rsync3 use an overly-restrictive server.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Added more conditional debug output.

    - Really big numbers are now output using our own big-num routine rather
      than casting them to a double and using a %.0f conversion.

    - The pool_alloc library has received some minor improvements in alignment
      handling.

    - The Makefile will not halt for just a timestamp change on the Makefile
      or the configure files, only for actual changes in content.

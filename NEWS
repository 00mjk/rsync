NEWS for rsync 2.6.6 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.5:

  BUG FIXES:

    - The outputting of hard-linked files when verbosity was > 1 was not right:
      without -i it would output the name of each hard-linked file as thought
      it had been changed (it now outputs a "is hard linked" message for the
      file); with -i it would could output all trailing dots for an unchanged
      hard-link (it now changes those dots to spaces, as is done for other
      unchanged files).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Made the "max verbosity" setting in the rsyncd.conf file settable on a
      per-module basis (which now matches the documentation).

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Made configure define NOBODY_USER (currently hard-wired to "nobody") and
      NOBODY_GROUP (set to either "nobody" or "nogroup" depending on what we
      find in the /etc/group file).

    - Added a test to the test suite, itemized.test, that tests the output of
      -i (log-format w/%i) and some double-verbose messages.

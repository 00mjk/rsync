NEWS for rsync 3.0.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed two buffer-overflow issues: one where a directory path that is
      exactly MAXPATHLEN was not handled correctly, and one handling a
      --backup-dir that is extra extra large.

    - Fixed a data-corruption issue when preserving hard-links without
      preserving file ownership, and doing deletions either before or during
      the transfer.  This fixes some assert errors in the hard-linking code,
      and some potential failed checksums (via -c) that should have matched.

    - Fixed a potential crash when an rsync daemon has a filter/exclude list
      and the transfer is using ACLs or xattrs.

    - Fixed a hang if a really large file is being processed by an rsync that
      can't handle 64-bit numbers.  Rsync will now complain about the file
      being too big and skip it.

    - For devices and special files, we now avoid gathering useless ACL and/or
      xattr information for files that aren't being copied.  (The uncopied
      files are still put into the file list, but there's no need to gather
      data that is not going to be used.)  This ensures that if the user uses
      --no-D, that rsync can't possibly complain about being unable to gather
      extended information from special files that are in the file list (but
      not in the transfer).

    - Properly handle requesting remote filenames that start with a dash.  This
      avoids a potential error where a filename could be interpreted as a
      (usually invalid) option.

    - Fixed a bug in the comparing of upper-case letters in file suffixes for
      --skip-compress.

    - If an rsync daemon has a module configured without a path setting, rsync
      will now disallow access to that module.

    - If the destination arg is an empty string, it will be treated as a
      reference to the current directory (as 2.x used to do).

    - Fixed a batch-file writing bug that would not write out the full set of
      compatibility flags that the transfer was using.  This fixes a potential
      protocol problem for a batch file that contains a sender-side I/O error:
      it would have been sent in a way that the batch-reader wasn't expecting.

    - Some improvements to the hard-linking code to ensure that device-number
      hashing is working right, and to supply more information if the hard-link
      code fails.

    - The --inplace code was improved to not search for an impossible checksum
      position.  The quadruple-verbose chunk[N] message will now mention when
      an inplace chunk was handled by a seek rather than a read+write.

    - If we fail to connect to an rsync daemon, report all the connection
      errors (e.g. IPv4 & IPv6), not just the last one.

    - Fixed an issue where an xattr and/or ACL transfer that used an alt-dest
      option (e.g. --link-dest) could output an error trying to itemize the
      changes against the alt-dest directory's xattr/ACL info but was instead
      trying to access the not-yet-existing new destination directory.

    - Improved xattr system-error messages to mention the full path to the
      file.

    - Avoid trying to read/write xattrs on certain file types for certain OSes.
      Improved configure to set NO_SYMLINK_XATTRS, NO_DEVICE_XATTRS, and/or
      NO_SPECIAL_XATTRS defines in config.h.

    - Improved the unsafe-symlink errors messages.

    - Fixed a bug setting xattrs on new files that aren't user writable.

    - Fixed a bug with --fake-super when copying files and dirs that aren't
      user writable.

    - If a temp-file name is too long, rsync now avoids truncating the name in
      the middle of adjacent high-bit characters.  This prevents a potential
      filename error if the filesystem doesn't allow a name to contain an
      invalid multi-byte sequence.

    - If a muli-protocol socket connection fails (i.e., when contacting a
      daemon), we now report all the failures, not just the last one.  This
      avoids losing a relevant error (e.g. an IPv4 connection-refused error)
      that happened before the final error (e.g. an IPv6 protocol-not-supported
      error).

    - Fix the popt arg parsing so that an option that doesn't take an arg will
      reject an attempt to supply one.

    - A couple minor option tweaks to support/rrsync script, and also some
      regex changes that make vim highlighting happier.

    - Fixed some issues in the support/mnt-excl script.

    - A few manpage improvements.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added ".hg/" to the default cvs excludes (see -C & --cvs-exclude).

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Use lchmod() whenever it is available (not just on symlinks).

    - A couple fixes to the socketpair_tcp() routine.

    - Updated the helper scripts in the packaging subdirectory.

    - Renamed configure.in to configure.ac.

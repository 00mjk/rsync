NEWS for rsync 3.0.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.9:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed the output of -ii when combined with one of the --*-dest options:
      it now itemizes all the items, not just the changed ones.

    - Made the output of all file types consistent when using a --*-dest
      option.  Prior versions used to output too many creation events for
      matching items.

    - The code that waits for a child pid now handles being interrupted by
      a signal.  This fixes a problem with the pre-xfer exec function not
      being able to get the exit status from the script.

    - A negated filter rule now sends the negation option when sending the
      filter rules.

    - Fixed a problem with -vv (double --verbose) and --stats when "pushing"
      files (which includes local copies).  Version 2.6.9 would complete the
      copy, but exit with an error when the receiver output its memory stats.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --delete-delay option, which is a more efficient way to
      delete files at the end of the transfer without needing a separate
      delete pass.

    - You may specify --max-delete=0 to a 3.0.0 client as long as the
      receiving side is at least version 3.0.0.  This means that you
      can pull from an older rsync with this option, but pushing to an
      older rsync will generate an error.  *Be sure to never specify a 0
      value to an older rsync client, or it will be silently ignored.*

  INTERNAL:

    - Added some isType() functions that make dealing with signed characters
      easier without forcing variables via casts.

    - Upgraded the included popt version to 1.10.2 and improved its use of
      string-handling functions.

    - Added missing prototypes for compatibility functions from the lib dir.

    - Configure determines if iconv() has a const arg, allowing us to avoid a
      compiler warning.

    - Made the sending of some numbers more efficient for protocol 30.

    - Improved the use of "const" on pointers.

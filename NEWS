NEWS for rsync 3.0.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.9:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed the output of -ii when combined with one of the --*-dest options:
      it now itemizes all the items, not just the changed ones.

    - Made the output of all file types consistent when using a --*-dest
      option.  Prior versions used to output too many creation events for
      matching items.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

  INTERNAL:

    - Upgraded the included popt version to 1.10.2 and improved its use of
      string-handling functions.

NEWS for rsync 2.6.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the exclude code where an anchored exclude without any
      wildcards fails to match an absolute source arg, but only when --relative
      is in effect.

    - Improved the I/O code for the generator to fix a potential hang when the
      receiver gets an EOF on the socket but the generator's select() call
      never indicates that the socket is writable for it to be notified about
      the EOF.  (This can happen when using stunnel).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The support/rsyncstats script has an improved line-parsing regex that is
      easier to read and also allows it to parse syslog-generated lines.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - A new patch was added: log-file.diff.  This contains an early version of
      a future option, --log-file=FILE, that will allow any rsync to log its
      actions to a file (which is only supported by a daemon at present).

NEWS for rsync 2.6.7 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.6:

  BUG FIXES:

    - If the user specifies a remote-host for both the source and destination,
      we now output a syntax error rather than trying to open the destination
      hostspec as a filename.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --append option that makes rsync append data onto files
      that are longer on the source than the destination (this includes new
      files).

    - If lutimes() and/or lchmod() are around, use them to allow the
      preservation of attributes on symlinks.

    - Added two config items to the rsyncd.conf parsing:  "pre-xfer exec"
      and "post-xfer exec".  These allow a command to be specified on a
      per-module basis that will be run before and/or after a daemon-mode
      transfer. 

  INTERNAL:

    - Some buffer sizes were expanded a bit, particularly on systems where
      MAXPATHLEN is overly small (e.g. cygwin).

    - If io_printf() tries to format more data than fits in the buffer, exit
      with an error instead of transmitting a truncated buffer.

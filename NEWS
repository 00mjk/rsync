NEWS for rsync 2.6.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the exclude code where an anchored exclude without any
      wildcards failed to match an absolute source arg, but only when
      --relative is in effect.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The support/rsyncstats script has an improved line-parsing regex that is
      easier to read and also allows it to parse syslog-generated lines.

NEWS for rsync 2.6.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the exclude code where an anchored exclude without any
      wildcards fails to match an absolute source arg, but only when --relative
      is in effect.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The support/rsyncstats script has an improved line-parsing regex that is
      easier to read and also allows it to parse syslog-generated lines.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - A new patch was added: log-file.diff.  This contains an early version of
      a future option, --log-file=FILE, that will allow any rsync to log its
      actions to a file (which is only supported by a daemon at present).

NEWS for rsync 3.0.3 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.2:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a wildcard matching problem in the daemon when a module has
      "use chroot" enabled.

    - Fixed a crash bug in the hard-link code.

    - The generator no longer allows a '.' dir to be excluded by a daemon-
      exclude rule.

    - Fixed the conversion of spaces into dashes in the %M log escape.

    - Moved the setting of the socket options prior to the connect().

    - If rsync exits in the middle of a --progress output, it now outputs a
      newline to prevent the progress line from being overwritten.

    - Fixed a problem with how a destination path with a trailing slash was
      compared against the daemon excludes.

    - Use the overflow_exit() function for overflows, not out_of_memory().

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The rsyncd.conf manpage now consistently refers to the parameters in
      the daemon config file as "parameters".

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed a testcase failure if the tests are run as root and made some
      compatibility improvements.

    - Ensure that the early patches don't cause any generated-file hunks to
      bleed-over into patches that follow.

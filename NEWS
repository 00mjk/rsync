rsync changes since last release

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With --progress, when a transfer is complete show the time taken;
      otherwise show expected time to complete. (Cameron Simpson)

    * Make "make install-strip" works properly, and "make install"
      accepts a DESTDIR variable for help in building binary packages.
      (Peter Breitenlohner, Greg Louis)


  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix situation where failure to fork (e.g. because out of process
      slots) would cause rsync to kill all processes owned by the
      current user.  Yes, really!  (Paul Haas, Martin Pool)

    * Fix test suite on Solaris.  (Jos Backus, Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor memory leak in socket code.  (Dave Dykstra, Martin
      Pool.)

    * Fix --whole-file problem that caused it to be the default even
      for remote connections.  (Martin Pool, Frank Schulz)

    * Work around bug in Mac OS X mkdir(2), which cannot handle
      trailing slashes.

NEWS for rsync 3.0.4 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Changed the hard-link code to never try to allocate 0 bytes of memory.
      This fixes a failure on some Operating Systems, such as AIX.

    -  Fixed a potential alignment issue in the IRIX ACL code when allocating
       the initial "struct acl" object.  Also, cast mallocs to avoid warnings.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Rsync will avoid sending an -e option to the server if an older protocol
      in requested (and thus the option would not be useful).  This lets the
      user specify the --protocol=29 option to access an overly-restrictive
      server.

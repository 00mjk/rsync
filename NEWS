rsync 2.5.1 (sometime in 2001?)

  BUG FIXES: 
   
    * Fix for segfault in --daemon mode configuration parser by Paul
      Mackerras.

    * Correct string<->address parsing for both IPv4 and 6.  Thankyou
      to YOSHIFUJI Hideaki, SUMIKAWA Munechika and Jun-ichiro "itojun"
      Hagino.

    * Various fixes for IPv6 support by Dave Dykstra.

    * rsync.1 typo fix by Matt Kraai.

    * Test suite typo fixes by Tom Schmidt.

    * rsync.1 grammar and clarity improvements.  Thanks to Edward
      Welbourne.

    * Correction to ./configure tests for inet_ntop.  Thankyou to Jeff
      Garzik.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * --progress and -P now show estimated data transfer rate (in a
        multiple of bytes/s) and estimated time to completion.  Based
        on a patch by Rik Faith.
   
    * --no-detach option, required to run as a W32 service and also
        useful when running on Unix under daemontools, AIX's SRC, or a
        debugger.  Thanks to Max Bowsher and Jos Backus.

    * Clearer error messages for some conditions.

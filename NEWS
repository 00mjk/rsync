NEWS for rsync 2.6.5 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.4:

  BUG FIXES:

    - A crash bug was fixed when a daemon had its "path" set to "/", did
      not have chroot enabled, and used some anchored excludes in the
      config file.

    - Fixed a case where the generator might try to tweak the write
      permissions of a read-only directory in list-only mode.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Changed the outputting of "safe" filenames to use backslash-escaped
      characters rather than '?'s.  Any non-printable character is output
      using octal (e.g. "\n" -> "\012"), and backslash is output as "\\".

  INTERNAL:

    - Rsync now calls setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "").

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - You can use --disable-locale to turn off any use of setlocale().

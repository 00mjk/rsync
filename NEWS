NEWS for rsync 3.0.7 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.6:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bogus free when using --xattrs with --backup.

    - Avoid an error when --dry-run  was trying to stat a prior hard-link file
      that hasn't really been created.

    - Improved --skip-compress's error handling of bad character sets and got
      rid of a lingering debug fprintf().

    - Fixed the daemon's conveyance of io_error value from the sender.

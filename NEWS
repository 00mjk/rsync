NEWS for rsync 3.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Changed the way --progress overwrites its prior output in order to make
      it nearly impossible for the progress to get overwritten by an error.

    - Improved the keep-alive in-loop check in the generator to work properly
      in incremental recursion mode.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --remote-option=OPT (-M OPT) command-line option that is useful
      for things like sending a remote --log-file=FILE or --fake-super option.

    - Added the --info=FLAGS and --debug=FLAGS options to allow finer-grained
      control over what is output.  Added an extra type of --progress output
      using --info=progress2.

    - Rsync will not send an -e option to the server if the user specifies the
      --protocol=29 option.  This lets rsync3 use an overly-restrictive server.

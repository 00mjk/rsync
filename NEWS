NEWS for rsync 3.0.1 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.0:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a crash bug when a single-use rsync daemon (via remote shell) was
      run without specifying a --config=FILE option.

    - Fixed a crash when backing up a directory that has a default ACL.

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of xattr values that could cause rsync to
      not think that a file's extended attributes are up-to-date.

    - Fixed the working of --fake-super with --link-dest and --xattrs.

    - Fixed a hang when combining --dry-run with --remove-source-files.

    - Fixed the building of the rounding.h file on systems that need custom
      CPPFLAGS to be used.  Also improved the error reporting if the building
      of rounding.h fails.

    - Fixed the use of th --protect-args (-s) option when talking to a daemon.

    - Fixed the --ignore-existing option's protection of files on the receiver
      that are non-regular file son the sender (e.g. if a symlink or a dir on
      the sender is trying to replace a file on the receiver).  The reverse
      protection (protecting a dir/symlink/device from being replaced by a
      file) was already working.

    - Fixed an assert failure if --hard-links is combined with an option that
      can cause a file in a set of hard-linked files to be skipped (i.e. if
      --append, --ignore-existing, etc. affects one or more files in a hard-
      linked set of files, but not all of them).

    - Avoid setting the time on a directory that already has the modify time
      that we're setting.  This avoids tweaking the dir's ctime.

    - Fixed the 'T'-flag itemizing of symlinks when --time isn't preserved.

    - Fixed a glitch in the itemizing of permissions with the -E option.

    - Added the 'c'-flag to the itemizing of non-regular files so that the
      itemized output doesn't get hidden if there were no attribute changes,
      and also so that the itemizing of a --copy-links run will distinguish
      between copying an identical non-regular file and the creation of a
      revised version with a new value (e.g. symlink referent, device
      numbers).

    - The --append option's restricting of transfers to those that add data no
      longer prevents the updating of non-content changes to otherwise up-to-
      date files (i.e. those with the same content but differing permissions,
      ownership, xattrs, etc.).

    - Don't allow --fake-super to be specified with -XX (double --xattrs)
      because they conflict.  If a daemon has "fake super" enabled, it
      automatically downgrades a -XX request to -X.

    - A daemon doesn't try to auto-refuse the "iconv" option if iconv-support
      wasn't compiled in to the daemon (avoiding a warning in the logs).

    - Fixed the support/rrsync script to work with the latest options that
      rsync sends (including its flag-specifying use of -e to the server).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - When getting an error while asking an older rsync daemon for a file
      listing, rsync will try to notice if the error is a rejection of the
      --dirs (-d) option and let the user know how to work around the issue.

    - Added a few more --no-OPTION overrides.

    - Improved the documentation of the --append option.

  INTERNAL:

    - Fixed a couple minor bugs in the included popt library (ones which I
      sent to the official popt project for inclusion in the 1.14 release).

    - Fixed a stat() call that should have been do_stat() so that the proper
      normal/64-bit stat() function gets called.  (Was in an area that should
      not have caused problems, though.)

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The configure script tries to get the user's compiler to not warn about
      unused function parameters if the build is not including one or more of
      the ACL/xattrs/iconv features.

    - The configure script now has better checks for figuring out if the
      included popt should be used or not.

    - Updated the build scripts to work with a revised FTP directory
      structure.

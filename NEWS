NEWS for rsync 3.1.1 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.1.0:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fix a failure to remove our partial-transfer temp file when interrupted
      (and not saving partial files).

    - Change the chown/group/xattr-set order to avoid losing some
      security-related xattr info (that is cleared on chown).

    - Fixed a bug in the early daemon protocol where a timeout failed to be
      honored (e.g. if the remote side fails to send us the initial protocol
      greeting).

    - Fixed unintended inclusion of commas in file numbers in the daemon log.

    - We once again send the 'f' sub-flag (of -e) to the server side so it
      knows that we can handle incremental-recusion directory errors properly.

    - Fixed an issue with too-agressive keep-alive messages causing a problem
      for older rsync versions early in the transfer.

    - Fix incorrect --dry-run backup-directory-creation messages when the
      backup dir is not an absolute path.

    - Fix a bug where a failed deletion might not affect the exit code.

    - Fix a bug that caused a failure when combining --delete-missing-args with
      --xattrs and/or --acls.

    - Fixed an itemize bug that affected the combo of --link-dest, -X, and -n.

    - Fixed a problem with delete messages not appearing in the log file when
      the user didn't use --verbose.

    - Improve chunked xattr reading for OS X.

    - Remove an attempted hard-link xattr optimization that was causing a
      transfer failure.  (If you need to interact with an rsync 3.1.0 using
      --hard-links & --xattrs, you can specify --protocol=30.)

    - Return an error if a buffer overflows in do_mknod().

    - Fixed a problem reading more than 16 ACLs on some OSes.

    - Try to speed up cygwin by switching back to using socketpair "pipes".

    - Added knowledge of a few new options to rrsync.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the support/rsync-no-vanished wrapper script.

    - Have configure more prominently mention when we failed to find yodl (in
      case the user wants to be able to generate manpages from *.yo files).

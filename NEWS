NEWS for rsync 3.0.6 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.5:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a hang in the batch-reading code with incremental recursion.

    - Fixed the daemon's socket code to handle the simultaneous arrival of
      multiple connections.

    - Fixed the parsing of an [IPv6_LITERAL_ADDR] when a USER@ is prefixed.

    - The sender now skips a (bogus) symlink that has a 0-length value, which
      avoids a transfer error in the receiver.

    - Fixed a case where the sender could die with a tag-0 error if there was
      an I/O during the sending of the file list.

    - Fixed the rrsync script to avoid a server-side problem when -e is at the
      start of the short options.

    - Fixed configure's erroneous use of target.

    - Fixed configure's --disable-debug option.

    - Fixed a run-time issue for systems that can't find iconv_open() by adding
      the --disable-iconv-open configure option.

NEWS for rsync 2.6.3 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 28 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.2:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a crash bug that might appear when --delete was used and
      multiple source directories were specified.

    - The --backup code no longer attempts to create some directories
      over and over again (generating warnings along the way).

    - Fixed a bug in the reading of the secrets file (by the daemon) and
      the password file (by the client):  the files no longer need to be
      terminated by a newline for their content to be read in.

    - If a file has a read error on the sending side, the receiver will
      no longer keep the resulting file unless the --partial option was
      specified.  (Note:  both sides must be running 2.6.3 for this to
      work -- older receivers always keep the file, and older senders
      don't tell the receiver that the file was not read correctly.)

    - Fixed an age-old crash problem with --read-batch on a local copy
      (rsync was improperly assuming --whole-file for the local copy).

    - Files specified in the daemon's "exclude" or "exclude from" config
      items are now excluded from being uploaded (assuming that the module
      allows uploading at all) in addition to the old download exclusion.

    - When using --backup without a --backup-dir, rsync no longer preserves
      the modify time on directories.  This avoids confusing NFS.

    - Fixed a bug in the daemon authentication code when using one of the
      batch-processing options.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The new option --keep-dirlinks (-K) allows you to symlink a directory
      onto another patition on the receiving side and have rsync treat it
      as matching a normal directory from the sender.

    - Added the "write only" option to the daemon's config file.

    - Added long-option names for -4 and -6 (namely --ipv4 and --ipv6)
      and documented all these options in the man page.

    - Improved the handling of the --bwlimit option so that it's less
      bursty, more accurate, and works properly over a larger range of
      values.

    - The rsync daemon-over-ssh code now looks for SSH_CONNECTION and
      SSH2_CLIENT in addition to SSH_CLIENT to figure out the IP address.

    - Added the --checksum-seed=N option for advanced users.

  INTERNAL:

    - Some cleanup in the exclude code has saved some per-exclude memory
      and made the code easier to maintain.

    - Use rsyserr() in the various places that were still calling
      rprintf() with strerror() as an arg.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Added a "gen" target to rebuild most of the generated files,
      including configure, config.h.in, the man pages, and proto.h.

    - If "make proto" doesn't find some changes in the prototypes, the
      proto.h file is left untouched (its timestamp used to be updated).

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The scripts in the testsuite dir were cleaned up a bit.

    - A few new diffs were added to the patches dir (and some accepted
      ones were removed as well).

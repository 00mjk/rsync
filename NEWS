NEWS for rsync 3.0.5 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.4:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Initialize xattr data in a couple spots in the hlink code, which avoids a
      crash when the xattr pointer's memory happens to start out non-zero.
      Also fixed the itemizing of an alt-dest file's xattrs when hard-linking.

    - Don't send a bogus "-" option to an older server if there were no short
      options specified.

    - Fixed skipping of unneeded updates in a batch file when incremental
      recursion is active.  Added a test for this.  Made batch-mode handle
      redos properly (and without hanging).

    - Fix the %P logfile escape when the daemon logs from inside a chroot.

    - Properly ignore (superfluous) source args on a --read-batch command.

    - Improved the manpage's description of the '*' wildcard to remove the
      confusing "non-empty" qualifier.

NEWS for rsync 3.1.2 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.1.1:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Make sure that an inc-recursive transfer includes the right directory-
      name prefixes for each dir.  This makes it impossible for a malicious
      sender to use a just-sent symlink as a path in a transfer.
    - Only skip set_modtime() on a transferred file if the time is exactly
      right.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added "(DRY RUN)" info to the --debug=exit output line.
    - Use usleep() for our msleep() function if it is available.
    - Added a few extra long-option names to rrsync script, which will make
      BackupPC happier.
    - Misc. manpage tweaks.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed a bug with the Makefile's use of INSTALL_STRIP.
    - Tweaks for newer versions of git in the packaging tools.

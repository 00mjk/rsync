NEWS for rsync 3.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (changed)
Changes since 3.0.4:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Changed the way --progress overwrites its prior output in order to make
      it nearly impossible for the progress to get overwritten by an error.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --remote-option=OPT (-M OPT) command-line option that is useful
      for things like sending a remote --log-file=FILE or --fake-super option.

    - Added the --info=FLAGS and --debug=FLAGS options to allow finer-grained
      control over what is output.  Added an extra type of --progress output
      using --info=progress2.

    - Output numbers in 3-digit groups by default (e.g. 1,234,567).  See the
      --human-readable option for a way to turn it off.  See also the daemon's
      "log format" parameter for a modifier that can request digit-grouping or
      human-readable output in log escapes (including --out-format).

    - Added a "T" (terabyte) category to the --human-readable size suffixes.

    - Enhanced the --stats output: 1) to mention how many files were created
      (protocol >= 28), 2) to mention how many files were deleted (new for
      protocol 31), and 3) to follow the file-count, created-count, and
      deleted-count with a break-out list of each count by type.

    - Added the --usermap/--groupmap/--chown options for manipulating file
      ownership during the copy.

    - Added the "%C" escape to the log-output handling, which will output the
      MD5 checksum of any transferred file, or all files if --checksum was
      specified (when protocol 30 or above is in effect).

    - Added the "reverse lookup" parameter to the rsync daemon config file to
      allow reverse-DNS lookups to be disabled.

  EXTRAS:

    - Added an "instant-rsyncd" script to the support directory, which makes
      it easy to configure a simple rsync daemon in the current directory.

    - Added the "mapfrom" and "mapto" scripts to the support directory, which
      makes it easier to do user/group mapping in a local transfer based on
      passwd/group files from another machine.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Added more conditional debug output.

    - Really big numbers are now output using our own big-num routine rather
      than casting them to a double and using a %.0f conversion.

    - The pool_alloc library has received some minor improvements in alignment
      handling.

    - Added init_stat_x() function to avoid duplication of acl/xattr init code.

NEWS for rsync 3.0.8 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a buffer-overflow issue where a directory path that is exactly
      MAXPATHLEN was not handled correctly.

    - Fixed a potential crash when an rsync daemon has a filter/exclude list
      and the transfer is using ACLs or extended attributes.

    - Fixed compression-ignoring of upper-case suffixes.

    - If the destination arg is an empty string, it will be treated as a
      reference to the current directory (as 2.x used to do).

    - Fixed a batch-file writing bug that would not write out the full set of
      compatibility flags that the transfer was using.  This fixes a potential
      protocol problem for a batch file that contains a sender-side I/O error:
      it would have been sent in a way that the batch-reader wasn't expecting.

    - Some improvements to the hard-linking code to ensure that device-number
      hashing is working right, and to supply more information if the hard-link
      code fails.

    - Fix the popt arg parsing so that an option that doesn't take an arg will
      reject an attempt to supply and arg.

    - A couple minor option tweaks to support/rrsync script, and also some
      regex changes that make vim highlighting happier.

    - A few manpage improvements.

    - A couple fixes to the socketpair_tcp() routine.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Updated the helper scripts in the packaging subdirectory.

    - Renamed configure.in to configure.ac.

NEWS for rsync 3.0.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.9:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed the output of -ii when combined with one of the --*-dest options:
      it now itemizes all the items, not just the changed ones.

    - Made the output of all file types consistent when using a --*-dest
      option.  Prior versions used to output too many creation events for
      matching items.

    - A negated filter rule now sends the negation option when sending the
      filter rules.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - You may specify --max-delete=0 to a 3.0.0 client as long as the
      receiving side is at least version 3.0.0.  This means that you
      can pull from an older rsync with this option, but pushing to an
      older rsync will generate an error.  *Be careful to never specify
      a 0 value to older rsync client, or it will be silently ignored.*

  INTERNAL:

    - Added some isType() functions that make dealing with signed characters
      easier without forcing variables via casts.

    - Upgraded the included popt version to 1.10.2 and improved its use of
      string-handling functions.

    - Added missing prototypes for compatibility functions from the lib dir.

    - Figure out if the iconv() function has a const arg to avoid a compiler
      warning.

    - Improved the use of "const" on pointers.

To build and install rsync

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

You may set the installation directory and other parameters by options
to ./configure.  To see them, use:

  $ ./configure --help

As of 2.4.7, rsync uses Eric Troan's popt option-parsing library.  A
cut-down copy of release 1.5 is included in the rsync distribution,
and will be used it there is no popt library on your build host, or if
the --with-included-popt option is passed to ./configure.
